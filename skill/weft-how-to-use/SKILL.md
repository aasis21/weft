description: Pair a phone to a running GitHub Copilot CLI session with Weft — show/refresh the QR code, pick a transport (Supabase realtime or a self-hosted Microsoft Dev Tunnel), manage the shared devtunnel relay, and run/manage the standalone `weft` Device Station CLI outside of any Copilot session. Use when the user asks to "pair my phone", "show the Weft QR", "switch Weft transport", "start/check/stop the weft devtunnel", "run weft standalone", or asks why `/weft` or `weft` isn't working.

# Weft — pair your phone to a Copilot CLI session

Weft lets a phone (the Weft mobile web app or APK) observe and approve a running
Copilot CLI session in real time: tool-call notifications, approval prompts, and a live
transcript. It ships as a Copilot CLI **extension** (`/weft` inside a session) plus a
standalone **`weft` CLI** (works with no Copilot session at all — e.g. to run a Device
Station on a headless box, or to manage the relay independently).

## Inside a Copilot CLI session — `/weft`

- `/weft` — show the pairing QR + status for the current session. If no transport is
  configured yet, this also prompts you to pick one.
- `/weft <name>` — override the transport for just this session without touching the
  saved config. Valid names: `supabase`, `devtunnel`, `clear`.
- Weft auto-loads at session start and prints one status line; nothing else happens
  until you run `/weft`.

## Standalone `weft` CLI (no Copilot session needed)

Installed alongside the extension as a `weft`/`weft.cmd` shim on PATH (open a **new**
terminal after install for PATH changes to take effect). Full command list:

```
weft start
weft add-project <name> <path> [--default]
weft remove-project <name>
weft list-projects
weft set-default <name>
weft set-transport <supabase|devtunnel|clear> [--url <url>] [--anon-key <key>]
weft show-transport
weft set-name <name>
weft show-name
weft set-pairing <persistent|ephemeral>
weft rotate-pairing
weft devtunnel <start|status|stop>
weft help
```

- **`weft start`** — runs a standalone "Device Station": pairs a phone the same way
  `/weft` does, but without needing an active Copilot CLI session (useful for headless
  boxes or testing transport setup independently).
- **`weft add-project` / `remove-project` / `list-projects` / `set-default`** — manage
  named project shortcuts the mobile app can launch a session into.
- **`weft set-transport` / `show-transport`** — the ONLY way transport is configured.
  There is **no env var, no `.env` file** — config lives solely in
  `~/.weft/weft.config.json`. Reinstalling or rebuilding the extension never touches
  this file, so a chosen transport always survives an update. Passing no flags to
  `set-transport devtunnel` is valid (devtunnel needs no URL/key); `supabase` needs
  `--url` and `--anon-key`.
- **`weft set-pairing persistent`** — reuse the same channel + key across every
  `weft start` / `/weft`, so an already-paired phone reconnects without rescanning the
  QR. Default is `ephemeral` (a fresh channel + key every run, forward-secret).
  `weft rotate-pairing` forces a new identity on demand.
- **`weft set-name` / `show-name`** — set (or check) the display name this machine
  shows to the phone in its DEVICES list. Defaults to the OS hostname until you set one;
  the installer (install.ps1/install.sh) also prompts for this interactively at install
  time, defaulting to the hostname (press Enter to keep it). Persisted alongside the
  transport in `~/.weft/weft.config.json` — reinstalling/rebuilding never resets it.
  Restart `weft start` / `/weft` for a changed name to reach an already-open session.
- **`weft devtunnel start`** — foreground command that provisions (or reuses) the
  shared Microsoft Dev Tunnel relay and blocks with a live status line until it's ready.
  If a healthy relay is already running, it short-circuits instantly instead of
  re-provisioning.
- **`weft devtunnel status`** — one-shot check: prints whether the shared relay is
  running, its pid, and its public URL, or "not running". **Always check status before
  assuming you need to start** — devtunnel provisioning is shared across sessions (a
  detached background process), so it's often already up.
- **`weft devtunnel stop`** — force-tears-down the shared relay (kills the detached
  process, deletes the cloud tunnel, clears the registry). Use for troubleshooting a
  stuck/stale tunnel.

## Picking a transport

| Transport | Setup | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `supabase` | Needs a Supabase project URL + anon key (`weft set-transport supabase --url <url> --anon-key <key>`) | No local process to manage; works from anywhere |
| `devtunnel` | `weft set-transport devtunnel` (no flags) — provisions a shared Microsoft Dev Tunnel relay on first use | Self-hosted / no third-party account needed, but requires the `devtunnel` CLI installed and a Microsoft account |

Microsoft Dev Tunnels caps accounts at 10 tunnels, which is why Weft provisions **one
shared relay** (not one per session) and reuses it — that's also why `devtunnel
status`/`stop` exist as independent commands, separate from any single Copilot session.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Weft: no transport configured"** → run `weft set-transport supabase --url <url>
  --anon-key <key>` or `weft set-transport devtunnel`, then retry `/weft` or `weft start`.
- **devtunnel seems stuck / taking a long time** → run `weft devtunnel status` in another
  terminal; if it reports "not running" after a couple minutes, `weft devtunnel stop`
  then retry.
- **After a fresh install/reinstall, previous transport choice is gone** → shouldn't
  happen (config is untouched by install/reinstall); run `weft show-transport` to
  confirm, and check `~/.weft/weft.config.json` exists.
- **`weft` command not found after install** → open a **new** terminal (PATH is updated
  per-user but existing shells don't pick it up).
